# 💳 Credit Risk & Credit Score Predictive Modeling 🏦  

## 🔍 Overview  
This repository focuses on **Credit Risk Assessment** and **Credit Score Prediction**, utilizing machine learning models to analyze factors influencing an individual's creditworthiness.  

By exploring various **classification and regression techniques**, we aim to build **accurate predictive models** that help financial institutions assess **loan default risk and credit scores**.  

📌 **Key Aspects of the Project:**  
- ✅ Understanding **Loan Intent, Loan Amount & Default Rate** 📊  
- ✅ Developing a **Credit Risk Assessment Model** using ML algorithms 🤖  
- ✅ Examining **Outstanding Debt & Credit Score Relationships** 💡  
- ✅ Deploying an **Interactive Model in Gradio** ⚡  
- ✅ Evaluating model performance using **Precision, Recall & Cross Validation** 🏆

## 🏦 Understanding Credit Scores & Risk Factors  

### 📈 **What Affects Credit Scores?**  
A credit score reflects an individual’s **financial behavior** and ability to **repay debt responsibly**. The following factors play a **major role in credit rating**:  

1️⃣ **Payment History** – On-time payments improve the score, while late payments lower it. ⏳  
2️⃣ **Credit Utilization** – Keeping credit card usage below **30%** is ideal. 📊  
3️⃣ **Credit History Length** – Longer credit history results in better scores. 🏆  
4️⃣ **Outstanding Debt** – Total owed debts impact risk evaluation. 💰  
5️⃣ **Credit Mix** – Diverse credit types help in better scoring. 🏦  
6️⃣ **New Credit Inquiries** – Too many applications may indicate financial stress. 🚨
