# Credit Risk and Credit Score Predictive Modeling

## Important Note:
### Factors that affect credit score:

1. Payment history: Record of on-time or late payments on credit amounts; Consistently making payments on time positively impacts credit score, late payments can lower it.
2. Credit Utilization: Ratio of current credit card balance to total available credit limit; Keeping this ratio low (below 30%) is 
                       beneficial for the credit score; High utilization indicates potential financial stress

3. Length of Credit history: Duration of time individual is using credit; A longer credit history generally improves credit score, as it 
		             provides more data on the borrower's credit behavior

4. Outstanding Debt: Total amount of debt currently owed, including credit card balances, loans, and mortgages; Paying down debt responsibly
	             contributes to a healthier credit score.

5. Credit Mix: Variety of credit accounts, such as retail accounts, installment loans, finance company accounts and mortgage loans;
               A healthy mix of credit types can positively impact the credit score.

6. New Credit Inquiries: Number of recent hard inquiries or applications for new credit; Frequent inquiries can lower credit score as it may
                         indicate higher risk of overextending financially.
